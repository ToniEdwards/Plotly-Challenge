# Plotly-Challenge

Utilized the dataset provided by the NC State Public Science Lab to create a dashboard which allows us to analyze results from the Belly Button Diversity Study. The study consists of 152 participants each of whom provided a bio sample from their navels in order for scientist to examine what kind of species may be living on this particular surface of the skin.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

The interactive dashboard which I have created can be used to select a specific sample and explore the biographic as well as biological information associated with the sample. The dashboard displays visualizations of the data results for quick and easy analysis of the amount of bacteria present in each sample.
